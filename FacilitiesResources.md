## FACILITIES & OTHER RESOURCES – UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES

**Laboratory:** Dr. Meyer’s lab occupies dedicated laboratory space on the 5th floor of the Engineering V (EV). EV opened in Fall of 2007 and provides a state-of-the-art research home for the Department of Bioengineering faculty members and their labs. Dr. Meyer is allotted over 800 square feet of space including laboratory and shared research support space. A portion of this (200 sq ft) is a dedicated, positive-pressure cell culture room. This space includes access to air/gas and vacuum connections at both the bench and hood locations, internal deionized water systems, and appropriately scaled HVAC and electrical service. Recent renovations (2017) have ensured the space is specifically tailored to the work proposed here. The lab space is within close proximity to shared resources, conference room space and office space. His lab members have access to dedicated, separate office space in the lab's own room for writing and study.

**Computational:** Dr. Meyer has eight Dell Optiplex Computers located in the laboratory and Imaging Core Facility which allow for powerful data analysis and graphic capabilities.  


Computer: The PI has two computers: (1) Dell PC located in the PI’s office (Windows XP Professional); and (2) a Compaq laptop model Evo N1000c (Pentium 4; 170GHz; 256 MB of RAM; Windows XP Professional). Each technician and student is equipped with a similar laptop. Skype for Windows (business version) telecommunication software and equipment is on hand for all members of the research team. The combination of these information technologies con- tributes to the potential for success by assuring both efficient data handling and optimal com- munication among members of the research team.


 He has a Dell Optiplex computer in his office which is linked to the Moffitt network as well.  Internet access will allow for rapid communication with collaborators and access to Medline and other sources of information.





**Office:** As a faculty member of the Bioengineering Department within the Samueli School Of Engineering, Dr. Meyer has an office one floor away from his laboratory.  Full administrative support is provided by the engineering school.  





Office: The PI’s 144 sq ft office is adjacent to his laboratory. It is equipped with desk, cre- denza, desk and task chairs, two 4-drawer filing cabinets and hardwired high-speed access. There is also access to the Internet through the University’s wireless network. The students’/ technician’s shared office space, which is 356 sq ft, has similar access and is equipped with four individual desks, four task chairs and four 2-drawer filing cabinets. These facilities ensure that the PI and his immediate research team will have the necessary space in which to formulate experiments, analyze results, and prepare manuscripts for publication.





**Institutional Support:** Multiple formal activities that are critical in stimulating transdisciplinary collaboration.




**Intellectual Rapport:** The academic structure is based solely around cancer and founded on an interdisciplinary ethic. There are many opportunities to meet, hear about, and discuss research, including: the MRI Faculty Forum, Program meetings, Team meetings, Grand Rounds, Research-In-Progress, an annual scientific retreat, and other special seminars.  




**Shared Resources:**



The Advanced Light Microscopy/ Spectroscopy Core is housed within the California NanoSystems Institute and provides consultation, services and support for the application of novel spectroscopic methods and advanced image analysis techniques for the study of macromolecules, cellular dynamics and nanoscale characterization of bio-materials.





MOFFITT RESOURCES AND SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT
o	Institutional Support: There are many formal activities that are critical in stimulating transdisciplinary collaboration.   An engaged senior leadership meets weekly and centralized recruitment by this group ensures that transdisciplinary objectives are met by targeting key positions that strengthen existing programs while at the same time providing new inter-programmatic points of collaboration identified by leadership. The Scientific Leadership Committee and the Research Institute Steering Committee meetings bring together senior leadership, program leaders, and department chairs to discuss scientfic direction, spur collaboration, and coordinate overall research activities. Moffitt’s programs are organized around multidisciplinary themes. The Total Cancer Care initiative that supports research under a unifying transdisciplinary theme.

o	Shared Resources:  Moffitt supports 14 shared resources, or cores.  They represent a vital component for the Center’s research by providing investigators access to the latest technology and highly skilled staff at reasonable costs.  Moffitt’s annual institutional support is over $7 million a year, which represents about 45% of annual operating costs for the cores.  Additional sources of operational support come from chargebacks and other grants, including the Cancer Center Support Grant.  Capital investment is also significant.  Over the last five years, Moffitt has invested over $10 million in new equipment.  

Each core is led by a Scientific Director, whose primary role is to oversee the scientific direction of the core and is supported by a day-to-day operational manager or staff scientist.  A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) coordinates tracking, scheduling, billing, across the Center.  Each core has an advisory committee to assist in the strategic planning, policy review and initial review of chargeback rates.  Depending on the core, these committees meet monthly to quarterly.  The advisory committees report to the Scientific Leadership Committee (SLC), which oversees all Cancer Center Support Grant activities and is chaired by the Deputy Center Director and Associate Center Director of Basic Science.  Membership of the SLC consists of the Center’s research leadership including the other Associate Center Directors, research Program Leaders, and research department Chairs.  The SLC is responsible for setting policy, approving fee schedules, planning and implementing new services and cores, and setting budgeting priorities for the cores.  The SLC reports to the Research Executive Committee, which consists of the Associate Center Directors and Vice President for Research and is chaired by the Center Director, Tom Sellers, Ph.D.
