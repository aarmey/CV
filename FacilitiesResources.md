## FACILITIES & OTHER RESOURCES – UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES


















### Facilities:

**Laboratory:** The PI is assigned a 1200 sq ft laboratory that is located in departmental space, adjacent to his office. It is subdivided into a general purpose area (800 sq ft), a positive- pressure cell-culture room (200 sq ft), a medium preparation area (100 sq ft) and a walk-in cold room (100 sq ft). Minor equipment (cost < $5K) in this space includes: .... These laboratory fa- cilities were specifically designed and equipped to support the continuum of research for which the project proposed here is the next step.

Animal: Specific pathogen-free mice (C57BL6) will be purchased from the Jackson Labora- tory, a supplier known for the high quality and reliability of the animals it provides. They will be housed in the institution’s AAALAC-accredited animal-care facility, which is in a dedicated build- ing adjacent to the one that houses the PI’s laboratory (see above). Cages will be located on laminar-flow racks in a 100 sq ft room dedicated to this project. In addition to oversight by a board-certified laboratory-animal veterinarian, all animal technicians are rigorously trained and certified. Microbiological, clinical pathological and necropsy diagnostic facilities are available on site, with back up from the State’s veterinary diagnostic laboratory. Success of the proposed re- search is critically dependent on the acquisition and maintenance of mice in a pathogen-free state. The facilities described will help ensure such quality.
Clinical: Not applicable.
Computer: The PI has two computers: (1) Dell PC located in the PI’s office (Windows XP Professional); and (2) a Compaq laptop model Evo N1000c (Pentium 4; 170GHz; 256 MB of RAM; Windows XP Professional). Each technician and student is equipped with a similar laptop. Skype for Windows (business version) telecommunication software and equipment is on hand for all members of the research team. The combination of these information technologies con- tributes to the potential for success by assuring both efficient data handling and optimal com- munication among members of the research team.
Office: The PI’s 144 sq ft office is adjacent to his laboratory. It is equipped with desk, cre- denza, desk and task chairs, two 4-drawer filing cabinets and hardwired high-speed access. There is also access to the Internet through the University’s wireless network. The students’/ technician’s shared office space, which is 356 sq ft, has similar access and is equipped with four individual desks, four task chairs and four 2-drawer filing cabinets. These facilities ensure that the PI and his immediate research team will have the necessary space in which to formulate experiments, analyze results, and prepare manuscripts for publication.
