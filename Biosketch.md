## A. Personal Statement

<!-- Briefly describe why you are well-suited for your role(s) in this project. Relevant factors may include: aspects of your training; your previous experimental work on this specific topic or related topics; your technical expertise; your collaborators or scientific environment; and/or your past performance in this or related fields, including ongoing and completed research projects from the past three years that you want to draw attention to (previously known as research support). -->

I have a background in biological engineering, with training in applied machine learning, cell signaling, and pharmacodynamics. My research broadly applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to study the complex signaling that underlies cell-to-cell communication and resistance to therapies. My lab is particularly interested in how signaling cues operate in combination to direct cancer and immune effector cell behavior and how we might optimally target their dysregulation. For example, my previous work has shown how (1) to use a pharmacodynamic model of IL-2 signaling across cell populations to engineer cell-specific cytokines, (2) IgG antibody effector function is transduced through multiple receptors and effector cells, (3) an RTK family expressed in cancer and innate immune cells is activated in response to extracellular cues in the tumor microenvironment, and (4) receptor crosstalk is a mechanism of signal diversification promoting breast tumor invasion.

My experience includes a track record of success mentoring graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and technical associates.

### Understanding and targeting receptor family communication

Receptor families can have many ligands and receptors while being expressed in distinct configurations across cell populations. This multi-layered multiplicity confounds intuition about how these receptors are regulated in homeostasis, dysregulated in disease, and might be targeted with therapies. Through a combination of modeling and experiment, we have been working to develop tools enabling improved understanding of these families' regulation and how best to target them (4). For example, we recently used a pharmacodynamic model of IL-2 signaling across cell populations to engineer cell-specific cytokines (1). Within the FcγR family, which enacts effector function in response to IgG antibodies, we showed that a multivalent binding model could predict effector function *in vivo* better than previously-used metrics, which will enable more potent anti-tumor antibodies (2). Within the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, we developed a kinetic model of AXL activation, mechanistically explaining the dependence of the receptor upon phosphatidylserine for activation (3). This basic understanding of γ~c~, TAM and FcγR signaling enables more rationally designed therapies and understanding of which factors in the extracellular environment drive response.

### Problem-driven computational methods development

Studying complex signaling requires approaches tailored to the biological system and the scientific challenge at hand. We have adopted a wide range of mathematical and computational methods to provide new views of cell signaling mechanisms. For example, in (1) we demonstrated how tensor factorization can help to visualize the high-dimensional response of the common gamma chain receptor cytokine family across ligands, responding cell populations, and dynamics. We have similarly taken advantage of tensor-based dimensionality reduction strategies to improve the analysis and interpretation of serology in cohort studies (2). One of the limitations in integrating mechanistic information about receptor-ligand families with machine learning models has been a scalable model of these interactions that can be described in vector forms. In (3), we develop such a model that can describe a wide array of multivalent, multi-specific interactions, potentially enabling new approaches such as dimensionality reduction schemes that mechanistically describe binding interactions. Finally, in (4) we developed a flexible extension of hidden Markov models to cell lineage trees. Through computational and experimental studies we show that lineage relationships help to more accurately classify phenotypic states in heterogeneous populations of cancer cells.

### Therapeutic resistance and design

The benefits cancer patients derive from targeted therapies are limited by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the many compensatory molecular changes that occur when one treats with a therapy. In (1) we explored a panel of resistance mechanisms to RTK inhibitors, showed that coordinate JNK/Erk/Akt measurement was essential to predict cellular response, and showed that the resistance mechanism's effects could be explained through their effects on these pathways. In (2), we showed that a common consequence of kinase inhibitors is reduced proteolytic shedding on the cell surface. This change switches the kinase dependence of cells, in turn driving resistance to therapy (in large part via AXL). These results highlight the complexity underlying targeted inhibitor response and demonstrate methods to understand and overcome it. The extracellular matrix environment also influences the effectiveness of targeted agents, and in (3) we identified that these resistance effects were determined in part through activation of Src. Targeting Src in combination with other agents resensitized cells within 3D ECM environments and _in vivo_. Finally, cancer drug responses can be reflected in different types of phenotypic responses. In (4), we developed a high-throughput assay to quantify proliferative and cell death responses in parallel. Using this and computational analysis, we identified that similar effects on cancer cell number had divergent effects on these two phenotypes, and the interactions between compounds (antagonistic/additive/synergistic) could appear different if this was not taken into account.

### Migration and metastasis mechanisms

Invasion and dissemination of cells underlie many diseases including cancer. Studying these processes is hindered by the complex regulation and the multiple biophysical steps involved. In earlier work, we quantified the growth factor responsiveness of cell migration overall and individual processes involved in cell migration, then compared each condition in its 3D invasion through the extracellular matrix (1). This identified that these same individual processes still regulated migration in 3D, but that the overall rate-limiting steps and thus migration response were different. By studying the signaling (3) and protease (2) regulation of migration, we then linked these processes and invasion to identify therapeutic possibilities.
