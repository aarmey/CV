## A. Personal Statement

<!-- Briefly describe why you are well-suited for your role(s) in the project described in this application. The relevant factors may include aspects of your training; your previous experimental work on this specific topic or related topics; your technical expertise; your collaborators or scientific environment; and your past performance in this or related fields (you may mention specific contributions to science that are not included in Section C). -->

I am well-suited with the requisite training and expertise to carry out the proposed project herein. I have a background in biological engineering, with training in applied machine learning, receptor-mediated cell signaling, and cancer. My research broadly applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to understanding the complex signaling that underlies tumor invasion and immune avoidance. A focus of this work is on the TAMR family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which drive tumor cell resistance, immune avoidance, and efferocytosis of phosphatidylserine-exposing debris. While early in my independent career, I have served as PI on a number of grants and supervised technicians, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates.

This application, while a new undertaking within my research program, builds upon, is strongly influenced by, and is enabled by my earlier work. My experience with both TAMR receptor signaling and data-driven analysis of signaling networks is a critical component to the success of this project. Each Aim of this proposal relies on careful integration of both quantitative experiments and systems-level analysis, a hallmark of my research program.

### TAMR receptor signaling

TAMR receptors play diverse roles in cancer progression as elucidated through genetic manipulation but their mechanisms of post-translational regulation are complex. As efferocytosis receptors, TAMRs have dual roles in mediating transport of extracellular debris as well as intracellular signaling. While small molecule and biologic TAMR inhibitors are in preclinical and clinical development, knowing where and in which patients TAMR therapies will be effective will aid translation of these therapies. These studies focused on the factors that drive AXL activation within carcinoma cells, and in turn the consequence of this activation. We first identified that AXL can be transactivated from ErbB receptors and that this transactivation drives the invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells more so than the signaling from the ErbB receptors themselves (2). Then, we developed a kinetic model of AXL activation, mechanistically explaining the dependence of the receptor upon phosphatidylserine for activation (1). This basic understanding of AXL signaling will allow for more rationally designed therapies and understanding of which factors in the tumor microenvironment lead to activation.

### Therapeutic resistance and design

The benefits cancer patients derive from targeted therapies are limited by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the many compensatory molecular changes that occur when one treats with a therapy. In (1) we explored a panel of resistance mechanisms to RTK inhibitors, showed that coordinate JNK/Erk/Akt measurement was essential to predict cellular outcome, and showed that the resistance mechanism's effects could be explained through their effects on these pathways. In (3) we showed that a complication of targeting autocrine growth factor signaling is the length-scales on which ligand release and recapture occur. Through a diffusion reaction model, we instead predicted and showed that inhibiting ligand release through protease inhibition is much more effective. In (2), we showed that a common consequence of kinase inhibitors is reduced proteolytic shedding on the cell surface. This change switches the kinase dependence of cells, in turn driving resistance to therapy (in large part via AXL). These results highlight the complexity underlying targeted inhibitor response and demonstrate methods to understand and overcome it.

### Migration and metastasis mechanisms

Invasion and dissemination of cells underlies many diseases including breast cancer. Studying these processes is complicated by their regulation on multiple levels, and the multiple biophysical steps involved. In earlier work, we studied cell migration overall and individual processes involved in cell migration, then compared them to 3D invasion through extracellular matrix (1). This identified that individual processes still regulated migration in 3D, but that the overall rate-limiting steps and thus migration response were different. By studying the signaling (3) and protease (2) regulation of migration, we then linked these processes to the invasive response to identify therapeutic approaches.
