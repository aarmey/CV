### Problem-driven computational methods development

Studying complex signaling requires approaches tailored to the biologic system and scientific challenge at hand. We have adopted a wide range of mathematical and computational methods to provide new views of cell signaling mechanisms. For example, in (1) we demonstrated how tensor factorization can help to visualize the high-dimensional response of the common gamma chain receptor cytokine family. In (2) we uncovered that the TAM receptor family senses local clusters of ligand, and used a partial differential equation model to explore this process. Finally, we have used Bayesian inference techniques of increasing scalability to perform robust parameterization of our models of interest (1, 3, 4).

### Therapeutic resistance and design

The benefits cancer patients derive from targeted therapies are limited by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the many compensatory molecular changes that occur when one treats with a therapy. In (1) we explored a panel of resistance mechanisms to RTK inhibitors, showed that coordinate JNK/Erk/Akt measurement was essential to predict cellular response, and showed that the resistance mechanism's effects could be explained through their effects on these pathways. In (3) we showed that a complication of targeting autocrine growth factor signaling is the length-scales on which ligand release and recapture occur. Through a diffusion-reaction model, we instead predicted and showed that inhibiting ligand release through protease inhibition is much more effective. In (2), we showed that a common consequence of kinase inhibitors is reduced proteolytic shedding on the cell surface. This change switches the kinase dependence of cells, in turn driving resistance to therapy (in large part via AXL). These results highlight the complexity underlying targeted inhibitor response and demonstrate methods to understand and overcome it.

### Migration and metastasis mechanisms

Invasion and dissemination of cells underlie many diseases including cancer. Studying these processes is hindered by the complex regulation and the multiple biophysical steps involved. In earlier work, we quantified the growth factor responsiveness of cell migration overall and individual processes involved in cell migration, then compared each condition in its 3D invasion through the extracellular matrix (1). This identified that these same individual processes still regulated migration in 3D, but that the overall rate-limiting steps and thus migration response were different. By studying the signaling (3) and protease (2) regulation of migration, we then linked these processes and invasion to identify therapeutic possibilities.
