## A. Personal Statement

<!-- Briefly describe why you are well-suited for your role(s) in the project described in this application. The relevant factors may include aspects of your training; your previous experimental work on this specific topic or related topics; your technical expertise; your collaborators or scientific environment; and your past performance in this or related fields (you may mention specific contributions to science that are not included in Section C). -->

I have a background in biological engineering with training in applied machine learning, cell signaling, and pharmacodynamics. My research broadly applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to study the complex signaling that underlies cell-to-cell communication and responses to perturbation. My lab is particularly interested in how signaling cues operate in combination to direct cancer and immune effector cell behavior and how we might optimally target their dysregulation. For example, my previous work has shown how (1) to use a pharmacodynamic model of IL-2 signaling across cell populations to engineer cell-specific cytokines, (2) IgG antibody effector function is transduced through multiple receptors and effector cells, (3) multi-modal dimensionality techniques can improve interpretation of high-throughput serology measurements, and (4) an RTK family expressed in cancer and innate immune cells is activated in response to extracellular cues in the tumor microenvironment.

I have extensive experience with projects that merge quantitative molecular biology with computational analysis such as in the work described here. This experience includes a track record of success mentoring graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and technical associates.

### Problem-driven computational methods development

Studying complex signaling requires approaches tailored to the biologic system and scientific challenge at hand. We have implemented, extended, and developed a wide range of mathematical and computational methods to provide new views of cell signaling mechanisms. For example, in (1) we demonstrated how tensor factorization can help to visualize the multi-dimensional response of the common gamma chain receptor cytokine family. More recently, we have extended this approach of multi-modal analysis to high-throughput serology measurements (2). Here, we show that multi-modal analysis offers more effective dimensionality reduction, improving model interpretation without reductions in our ability to predict antibody-mediated protection. A focus of our group has been effective integration of data-driven and mechanistic modeling techniques to leverage the strengths of each approach (1, 3, 4). In (3) we uncovered that the TAM receptor family senses local clusters of ligand, and used a partial differential equation model to explore this process. Finally, we have used Bayesian inference techniques of increasing scalability to perform rigorous parameterization of our models of interest (1, 3, 4).

### Understanding and targeting receptor family communication

Receptor families can have many ligands and receptors while being expressed in distinct configurations across cell populations. This multi-layered multiplicity confounds intuition about how these receptors are regulated in homeostasis, dysregulated in disease, and might be targeted with therapies. Through a combination of modeling and experiment, we have been working to develop tools enabling improved understanding of these families' regulation and how best to target them (4). For example, we recently used a pharmacodynamic model of IL-2 signaling across cell populations to engineer cell-specific cytokines (1). Within the FcγR family, which enacts effector function in response to IgG antibodies, we showed that a multivalent binding model could predict effector function *in vivo* better than previously-used metrics, which will enable more potent anti-tumor antibodies (2). Within the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, we developed a kinetic model of AXL activation, mechanistically explaining the dependence of the receptor upon phosphatidylserine for activation (3). This basic understanding of γ~c~, TAM and FcγR signaling enables more rationally designed therapies and understanding of which factors in the extracellular environment drive response.

### Therapeutic resistance and design

The benefits cancer patients derive from targeted therapies are limited by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the many compensatory molecular changes that occur when one treats with a therapy. In (1) we explored a panel of resistance mechanisms to RTK inhibitors, showed that coordinate JNK/Erk/Akt measurement was essential to predict cellular response, and showed that the resistance mechanism's effects could be explained through their effects on these pathways. In (3) we showed that a complication of targeting autocrine growth factor signaling is the length-scales on which ligand release and recapture occur. Through a diffusion-reaction model, we instead predicted and showed that inhibiting ligand release through protease inhibition is much more effective. In (2), we showed that a common consequence of kinase inhibitors is reduced proteolytic shedding on the cell surface. This change switches the kinase dependence of cells, in turn driving resistance to therapy (in large part via AXL). These results highlight the complexity underlying targeted inhibitor response and demonstrate methods to understand and overcome it.

### Migration and metastasis mechanisms

Invasion and dissemination of cells underlie many diseases including cancer. Studying these processes is hindered by the complex regulation and the multiple biophysical steps involved. In earlier work, we quantified the growth factor responsiveness of cell migration overall and individual processes involved in cell migration, then compared each condition in its 3D invasion through the extracellular matrix (1). This identified that these same individual processes still regulated migration in 3D, but that the overall rate-limiting steps and thus migration response were different. By studying the signaling (3) and protease (2) regulation of migration, we then linked these processes and invasion to identify therapeutic possibilities.
