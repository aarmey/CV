## A. Personal Statement

<!-- Briefly describe why you are well-suited for your role(s) in the project described in this application. The relevant factors may include aspects of your training; your previous experimental work on this specific topic or related topics; your technical expertise; your collaborators or scientific environment; and your past performance in this or related fields (you may mention specific contributions to science that are not included in Section C). -->

Our lab's focus on undergraduate research and preparing students for graduate training makes it an excellent environment for this R25 proposal on cancer genomics. I see research as central to undergraduate education and an excellent activity to develop one’s communication skills and independent critical thinking. Undergraduate students in our lab are fully integrated into the research process, including presenting within lab meetings, meeting with me directly during weekly project-specific updates, and eventually independently defining their research direction. More experienced students also present in external campus and national settings, including at the QCBio Annual Retreat, Biomedical Engineering Society Annual Meeting, and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.

The scale of undergraduate research in our lab speaks to its importance. I have mentored over 30 undergraduate students for at least one quarter since moving to UCLA in 2017. The majority of these students spend 10–15 hours/week on research, continue for more than a year, and elect to receive course credit. Currently, I mentor 10 undergraduates on independent research projects. Authors who participated as undergraduate researchers in our lab are italicized below. Additionally, S.D. Taylor and C. Posner participated as post-baccalaureate staff and have now gone on to graduate training.

Ensuring access to undergraduate research, particularly for students of diverse backgrounds, requires financially supporting their work. I explicitly budget funds for summer undergraduate student stipends in our grants and have consistently supported at least two students each summer full-time. Our students have also received campus and national awards including from the Undergraduate Research Fellows Program, Undergraduate Research Scholars Program, Rose Hills Foundation Fellowship, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and Cathy Bank Scholarship. To ensure that I am offering the best possible training environment for our diverse lab members, I have undergone mentorship training through programs in Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics; the Citizen Science Program; and the Biomedical Engineering Society. I am scheduled to complete mentorship training at UCLA in the coming months as well. Recently, my contributions to undergraduate education were recognized with the 2021 Northrop Grumman Excellence in Teaching Award.

### Understanding and targeting receptor family communication

Receptor families can have many ligands and receptors while being expressed in distinct configurations across cell populations. This multi-layered multiplicity confounds intuition about how these receptors are regulated in homeostasis, dysregulated in disease, and might be targeted with therapies. Through a combination of modeling and experiment, we have been working to develop tools enabling improved understanding of these families' regulation and how best to target them (4). For example, we recently used a pharmacodynamic model of IL-2 signaling across cell populations to engineer cell-specific cytokines (1). Within the FcγR family, which enacts effector function in response to IgG antibodies, we showed that a multivalent binding model could predict effector function *in vivo* better than previously-used metrics, which will enable more potent anti-tumor antibodies (2). Within the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, we developed a kinetic model of AXL activation, mechanistically explaining the dependence of the receptor upon phosphatidylserine for activation (3). This basic understanding of γ~c~, TAM and FcγR signaling enables more rationally designed therapies and understanding of which factors in the extracellular environment drive response.

### Problem-driven computational methods development

Studying complex signaling requires approaches tailored to the biologic system and scientific challenge at hand. We have adopted a wide range of mathematical and computational methods to provide new views of cell signaling mechanisms. For example, in (1) we demonstrated how tensor factorization can help to visualize the high-dimensional response of the common gamma chain receptor cytokine family. In (2) we uncovered that the TAM receptor family senses local clusters of ligand, and used a partial differential equation model to explore this process. Finally, we have used Bayesian inference techniques of increasing scalability to perform robust parameterization of our models of interest (1, 3, 4).

### Therapeutic resistance and design

The benefits cancer patients derive from targeted therapies are limited by genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the many compensatory molecular changes that occur when one treats with a therapy. In (1) we explored a panel of resistance mechanisms to RTK inhibitors, showed that coordinate JNK/Erk/Akt measurement was essential to predict cellular response, and showed that the resistance mechanism's effects could be explained through their effects on these pathways. In (3) we showed that a complication of targeting autocrine growth factor signaling is the length-scales on which ligand release and recapture occur. Through a diffusion-reaction model, we instead predicted and showed that inhibiting ligand release through protease inhibition is much more effective. In (2), we showed that a common consequence of kinase inhibitors is reduced proteolytic shedding on the cell surface. This change switches the kinase dependence of cells, in turn driving resistance to therapy (in large part via AXL). These results highlight the complexity underlying targeted inhibitor response and demonstrate methods to understand and overcome it.

### Migration and metastasis mechanisms

Invasion and dissemination of cells underlie many diseases including cancer. Studying these processes is hindered by the complex regulation and the multiple biophysical steps involved. In earlier work, we quantified the growth factor responsiveness of cell migration overall and individual processes involved in cell migration, then compared each condition in its 3D invasion through the extracellular matrix (1). This identified that these same individual processes still regulated migration in 3D, but that the overall rate-limiting steps and thus migration response were different. By studying the signaling (3) and protease (2) regulation of migration, we then linked these processes and invasion to identify therapeutic possibilities.
