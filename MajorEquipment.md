## EQUIPMENT - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES

Meyer Laboratory --- The laboratory is equipped all necessary equipment for performing the proposed work, including:

- Multiple electrophoresis units
- Thermocycler
- Swing-bucket centrifuge
- Fixed-angle high-speed centrifuge
- Two microfuges
- Two bacterial shakers and incubators
- Photographic equipment for documentation of gels and microscopy
- Refrigerators
- Standard freezers
- One –80℃ freezer
- NanoDrop spectrophotometer

Cell culture facilities (biological safety cabinets, incubators, microscopes, assorted other equipment) are all contained in a tissue culture room exclusive to the Meyer lab. Included in the Meyer lab's cell culture facility in one of the Meyer lab incubators is an Incucyte Zoom live-cell imaging system. This system provides real-time monitoring of cells in culture and is equipped with software and hardware for automated cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis assays.

In addition, there is extensive shared equipment and services available across the UCLA campus. As a member of the Jonsson Cancer Center and the Broad Stem Cell Center, Dr. Meyer has access to extensive resources within the core facilities including flow cytometry, genomics, molecular screening, small animal imaging, translational pathology, high-throughput sequencing, imaging, and biostatistics. These services are available to members of the centers at a subsidized rate.
