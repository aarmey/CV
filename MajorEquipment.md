## EQUIPMENT - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES








Meyer Laboratory
Dr. Meyer’s lab occupies dedicated laboratory space on the 5th floor of the Engineering V (EV). EV opened in Fall of 2007 and provides a state-of-the-art research home for the Department of Bioengineering faculty members and their labs. Dr. Meyer is allotted over 800 square feet of space including laboratory and shared research support space. This consists of laboratory space for himself and his research team. 


Cell culture facilities (biological safety cabinets, incubators, microscopes, assorted other equipment) are all contained in a tissue culture room exclusive to the Meyer lab. This space includes all necessary equipment for performing the proposed work, including a Luminex assay reader and fluorescence microscopes. Included Dr. Meyer’s cell culture facility in one of the Meyer lab incubators is an Incucyte Zoom live-cell imaging system. This system provides real-time monitoring of cells in culture and is equipped with software and hardware for automated cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis assays. The Meyer lab maintains 8- and 32-core workstations for high-demand computational loads, and all computers are backed up offsite continually.

In addition, there is extensive shared equipment and services available across the UCLA campus. As a member of the Jonsson Cancer Center and the Broad Stem Cell Center, Dr. Meyer has access to extensive resources within the core facilities including flow cytometry, genomics, molecular screening, small animal imaging, translational pathology, high-throughput sequencing, imaging, and biostatistics. These services are available to members of the centers at a subsidized rate.
